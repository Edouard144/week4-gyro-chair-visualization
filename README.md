# Week 4 – Gyroscope Controlled 3D Chair Visualization

### 🎯 Learning Objective
Use MPU6050 gyroscope data to control a 3D chair model in real time.

### 🧰 Tools
- MPU6050
- Arduino UNO
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pyserial, matplotlib, numpy

### ⚙️ Setup
1. Upload `mpu6050_chair.ino` to Arduino.
2. Run `main_3d_chair.py` on your PC.
3. Move the sensor — the 3D chair rotates according to pitch, roll, and yaw.

### 🧩 Expected Outcome
- Chair tilts (pitch)
- Chair rolls (side motion)
- Chair spins (yaw)
- Smooth 3D rotation in real time
